The Standard Model (SM) is an elegant and successful theory, though not complete: 
\\[10pt]
\begin{itemize}
\item{The mathematical description stops to be well defined at very high energy scale (experimentally unaccessible).}\\[10pt]
\item{New Physics is also expected at much lower scales, like the ones that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently (and in future) probing.}\\[10pt]
\item{Discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experiments give a great opportunity to understand the underlying patterns of SM physics and investigate possible new scenarios.}\\[10pt]
\item{ Anomalies have already been found and many more might hide in the huge amount of data that still need to be analyzed. }
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item{The central question is how to describe the interaction between two or more particles!?}\\[10pt]
\item{It turns out that there's no analytical finite solution, even in the simplest case..}\\[10pt]
\item{ but it also turns out that most of the time are satisfied conditions that allow to treat this very complex problem as a sum of smaller and more tractable processes.}\\[10pt]
\item{This leads to a series expansion, in which each of the pieces is supposed to be less and less relevant $\rightarrow$ the series can be truncated at the desired order (at a hopefully little cost).}
