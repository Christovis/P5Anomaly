##          T3PS v1.0            ##
###################################

These are short instructions to the usage of the T3PS parameter scanner tool
version 1.0.2. For contact and licensing information, see the end of this file.

###################################
##     Usage and Requirements    ##
###################################

T3PS already works out of box after simply extracting the .tar.gz file
  $ tar xvfz T3PS-1.0.2.tar.gz
  $ cd T3PS-1.0.2
which you might have to slightly adjust depending on which version you 
downloaded. (You probably have done this already since you are reading this.)

Necessary requirements are a Python interpreter compatible with version 2.7,
e.g. CPython 2.7 or higher or PyPy version 1.5 or higher. Currently, T3PS only
runs on Unix-like operating systems, specifically ones that expose a fork()
system call. However, Cygwin support is very much experimental.

It can be started using Python 
  $ python src/t3ps
or directly 
  $ ./src/t3ps
if the current user has rights to execute it (execute `chmod u+x src/t3ps.py'
if not). This will show a list of scan definition files in the current working
directory. The list will only consist of the file `QuickStart.scan' if executed
in the package folder after extraction.

Parameter scan definitions can also be launched directly using:
  $ ./src/t3ps QuickStart.scan
This will show a review of the scan definition and will start the scan after
confirmation by the user. You may wish to compare the output data stored in the
file `QuickStart.scan.data' after completion with the sample output file
`QuickStart.scan.data.sample' provided with the T3PS package.

For more details, see the manual and command line help available through
  $ ./src/t3ps --help

If you want to properly install T3PS, you can also use
  $ make install
in the T3PS folder, which will ask you for an installation folder and whether
you want to make a link to T3PS in /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. It can then be 
started using
  $ t3ps
from anywhere in the file-system.

Once installed this way, it can be uninstalled using:
  $ make uninstall
from the T3PS folder (the extracted one or the installed one).

* HiggsMass_recalc.scan.data    
                            - sample output of HiggsMass_recalc.scan

All output samples were obtained with `--randomseed 11630' and 8 concurrent
processes running on Python 2.7.3. Note that the micrOMEGAs code used for the
ScalarDM scan might yield slightly different results on the first run as it
builds up its archive of used matrix elements.
For more details on how to setup the example scans, see the SETUP file included
in each subfolder of the `examples' folder.

If you happen to encounter a problem, feel free to send an email to
    maurervi@web.de or t3ps@projects.hepforge.org
explaining the situation in which it occurred. We will then try to fix it as soon
as possible. Additional useful information you might include is contained in:
the scan definition file generating the error, the `.log' file belonging to the
scan run in question, possibly output from T3PS running in `--debug' mode and
enough offending data to reproduce the problem.
